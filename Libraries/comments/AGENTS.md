# Agent Notes (Comments Library)

- First-party reusable comments module. Keep files ≤500 lines.
- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` and bump the package version on every change.
- Keep `README.md` usage examples accurate. Update docs when APIs change.
- Tests or runnable examples are encouraged for new behavior.
- Favor lightweight helpers and types that can be shared across apps.
